Azure Virtual Network Setup Lab

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Azure Virtual Network Setup Lab**! In this lab, you will learn how to create and configure a secure and scalable virtual network within Microsoft Azure. Virtual networks (VNets) are a foundational component of cloud-based infrastructure, enabling the communication between Azure resources and providing a secure environment for your applications and services.

Azure Virtual Networks are crucial for ensuring secure and isolated communication between resources within the cloud, preventing unauthorized access. They enable seamless connectivity with on-premises infrastructure, allowing for hybrid cloud scenarios and secure data exchange. By providing control over IP addressing and scalability, VNets offer flexibility to grow your infrastructure while optimizing performance and cost-efficiency.

This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up an Azure Virtual Network from scratch, covering key concepts such as subnets, network security groups (NSGs), and routing. By the end of this lab, you will have a fully functional Azure Virtual Network tailored to your specific needs, providing you with a solid understanding of how networking works in the Azure cloud environment.

Lab: Create a Virtual Network (VNet)
Goal:

•	Understand the concept of cloud deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid) and networking in the cloud by creating and configuring a Virtual Network (VNet) in Microsoft Azure.

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Virtual Network (VNet) and define its address space.
- Configure subnets to segment the network for different services.
- Set up Network Security Groups (NSGs) to secure resources within the VNet.
- Explore routing, and understand how Azure handles traffic between virtual machines and other resources.
- Learn how to connect your VNet to other networks, including on-premises resources, if required.

Whether you're new to Azure or looking to deepen your cloud networking knowledge, this lab will provide you with the practical skills needed to confidently design and manage Azure Virtual Networks.

Let's get started!

Steps for Creating a Virtual Network (VNet):

Step 1: Go to the Azure Portal

•	Open your web browser and go to Azure Portal.

•	Sign in with your Microsoft account (you’ll need an Azure account to proceed; if you don’t have one, you can create a free trial account).

Step 2: Create a Virtual Network (VNet)

1.	Open the Portal Menu:
   
o	Once you're logged into the Azure Portal, look at the left-hand sidebar.

o	Select "Create a resource"  icon at the top of the page.
